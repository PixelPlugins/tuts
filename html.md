# HTML Tutorial

html is a simple way to make styled text with images and other embeded media. It is broken down into "tags".

A tag is done like this:

<tag-name>whatever goes inside the tag</tag-name>

For example, the "b" tag makes the text in it bold.

\<b\>Bold Text\</b\> shows as **Bold Text**.

## Making Links
You can add links to other pages in html. When someone clicks on a link, they are automatically taken there.

A link is broken down into two parts: the url and the text. The url is where the link goes to. The text is the text the person clicks on to get here. Format it like this

\<a href="http://page-to-go-to"\>link text\</a\>

Example: \<a href="http://www.google.com"\>Go to google\</a\> shows up as [Go to google](http://www.google.com)
