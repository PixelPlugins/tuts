# HTML Tutorial

html is a simple way to make styled text with images and other embeded media. It is broken down into "tags".

A tag is done like this:

<tag-name>whatever goes inside the tag</tag-name>

For example, the "b" tag makes the text in it bold.

\<b\>Bold Text\</b\> shows as **Bold Text**.

## Making Links
You can add links to other pages in html. When someone clicks on a link, they are automatically taken there.

A link is broken down into two parts: the url and the text. The url is where the link goes to. The text is the text the person clicks on to get here. Format it like this

\<a href="http://page-to-go-to"\>link text\</a\>

Example: \<a href="http://www.google.com"\>Go to google\</a\> shows up as [Go to google](http://www.google.com)

## Images
You can show images in html. Do it like this:

\<img src="http://image-web-address"\>    Notice how you don't close the image tag with \</img\>. Some tags you don't close.

Example:

\<img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/013/564/doge.jpg"\> shows as <img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/013/564/doge.jpg">

## Making Text Large (Headers)
You can make text large in html with headers.

\<h1\>\Header 1 Text</h1\>

Replace h1 with h2, h3, h4, h5, or h6. The larger the number, the smaller the text. The largest number is 6, meaning h6 is the smallest header.

Example: \<h1\>\Header 1</h1\> Shows as <h1>Header 1</h1>    Notice how headers are always on a seperate line.
