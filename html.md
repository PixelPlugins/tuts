# HTML Tutorial

html is a simple way to make styled text with images and other embeded media. It is broken down into "tags".

A tag is done like this:

<tag-name>whatever goes inside the tag</tag-name>

For example, the "b" tag makes the text in it bold.

\<b\>Bold Text\</b\> shows as **Bold Text**.
